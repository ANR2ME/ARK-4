Use this loader for compatibility with ARK-2 PBOOT.PBP bubble loader.
In ARK-2, PBOOT.PBP would load ARK.BIN into scratchpad ram.
In ARK-4 this was changed to user ram due to limitations in scratchpad size (16KB).
The loader's main function interface was also changed.
This loader acts as if it were ARK-2's ARK.BIN, but simply chainloads to ARK-4's ARK.BIN, acting as a wrapper.
