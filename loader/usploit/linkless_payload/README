ARK Linkless Loader.
We handcrafted this ARK loader to function with any game exploit.
It doesn't matter where it's loaded in RAM, and it requires no configuration.
However, due to the heavy load of the algorithms involved in the
process of dynamically detecting the components needed,
this loader is much slower than the static loader.
However it is the default loader shipped with ARK and the most recommended
in you don't know what to do or the scenario doesn't present with the information
needed to build a static loader.


Original README by qwikrazor87

ARK.BIN loader that works no matter where it's loaded in RAM.

load address/size/file are defined at the bottom of the asm file.

It passes the savedata folder path, example,
	ms0:/PSP/SAVEDATA/LOL IM A SAVEDATA FOLDER PATH NOW USE ME TO LOAD ARK.BIN .D-<-</

The path is grabbed from the original binloader path so you might want to strcpy it somewhere else in ARK.BIN.

Update:
The path is now copied to 0x08803800.
