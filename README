---- except actual savedata files: ICON0.PNG, PARAM.SFO, SECURE.BIN, SAVEAUTO.BIN, SAVEUTIL.BIN



CUSTOMIZATION



* By installing Plugins
You can install plugins by creating a file called PLUGINS.TXT in the /SEPLUGINS/ folder and/or ARK's savedata folder.

- Add a line of text for each plugin using the following format:
game, ms0:/path_to_my_game_plugin.prx, enabled
pops, ms0:/path_to_my_psx_plugin.prx, 1
vsh, ms0:/path_to_my_vsh_plugin.prx, true

You can also enable plugins on a per game basis.
For example, enable lcscheatdevice on GTA Liberty City Stories US Version:
ULUS10041, ms0:/seplugins/lcscheatdevice.prx, on


- You can use keywords "enabled", "on", "1" or "true" to indicate that the plugin is enabled, anything else disables it. You can use game, pops or vsh keywords to run the plugin in the corresponding runlevel.

- You can use the following keywords to tell ARK when the plugin loads:
---- all/always: if either of these keywords are used, the plugin will always load.
---- umd: plugin should only load on retail games (UMD/ISO/PSN).
---- homebrew: plugin should only load on homebrews.
---- game: plugin can load on both retail games and homebrews.
---- pops: plugin only loads in PSX games.
---- vsh: plugin only loads in the XMB.
---- game ID: if you specify a game ID (i.e. SLUS000000), then the plugin will only load on that game.




* By configuring ARK

- You can create a SETTINGS.TXT file using the same format as PLUGINS.TXT to enable/disable some CFW functionality on different parts of the system.

- For example, you can overclock to highest CPU speed like this:
always, overclock, on

- Another example, overclock only on games, use powersaving on VSH:
game, overclock, on
vsh, powersave, on

- You can use the same runlevels as used in plugins to tell ARK when the settings take effect (all/always, umd, homebrew, game, pops, vsh).

* Configuration settings for ARK:
- overclock: use this for better performance at the expense of battery time. Sets CPU/BUS speed to 333/166.
- powersave: use this for better battery life at the expense of performance. Sets CPU/BUS speed to 133/66.
- usbcharge: enables USB charging whereever you want.
- launcher: replaces the XMB with a custom menu launcher.
- disablepause: disables the pause game feature on PSP Go.
- highmem: enables high memory on models above 1K. You should only use this on homebrew runlevel as retail games were not meant to use the extra memory, and this can cause issues with cheat devices or other plugins that except games to have their data at specific memory addresses.


* You can also customize ARK by using the "launcher" setting, which replaces the XMB with whatever custom launcher you have installed.
ARK includes a custom launcher, but there have been many others created by scene members, some better looking, some with more features,
some more simpler, but all of them with personality, dedication and love from the community. Here is a list of all popular menus for ARK:
- ONEMenu: https://github.com/ONElua/ONEmenu/releases
- vMenu: http://www.mediafire.com/file/7acb5mhawx4gr9t/vMenu_ARK.7z/file
- yMenu: https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0B0kWUCdtGmJwLUhRUlNJSWhMWVE
- gMenu: http://www.mediafire.com/file/oou5490qc99vr7d/gmenuARK.rar/file
* Note: some of these menus have not been updated or supported by their developers in a while, they may not work well with modern ARK or real PSP hardware.
