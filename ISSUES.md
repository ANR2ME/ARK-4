# CFW Issues
- Returning from standby in PSX games results in "memory stick cannot be accessed" error.
- Cannot delete ISOs in XMB.
- PS1 games on Vita are not working in ePSP mode.
- UMD ripping tools fail <- most likely due to CFW lacking some features.
- Some plugins don't load (i.e. popsloader and cdda_enabler) <- most likely due to CFW lacking some features.
- Loading PRX files from ms0 with the ~PSP flag instead of the .ELF flag gives Unsuported PRX Type Error (0x80020148)

# Launcher Issues
- Weird dual screen bug that seems to be random.
- Incompatible with non-ASCII characters.
