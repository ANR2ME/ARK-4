# CFW Issues
- PS1 games don't work on PS Vita (I'm investigating it but even if they work they would have no sound).
- Popsloader doesn't work. The popsloader plugin is heavily CFW-oriented, meaning a specific one for ARK needs to be made.
- Leda doesn't work and I have no idea why.
- DAX format games have memory issues.

# Launcher Issues
- Incompatible with non-ASCII characters.
