# CFW Issues
- PS1 games don't work on PS Vita (there are two ways to fix this and each of them is not fully explored yet).
- Leda doesn't work and I have no idea why. You can use eLoader as an alternative for legacy homebrew.
- DAX format games have memory issues. This format was experimental and buggy, it's recommended to use the newer and better JSO and ZSO formats.
- Highmem support on PS Vita is experimental.

# Launcher Issues
- Incompatible with non-ASCII characters.
